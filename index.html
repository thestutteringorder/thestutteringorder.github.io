<h2 align="center" class="zoom-in">Mission Statement</h2>
<div class="container"><p><i>
            The goal of the server is to be able to help out as many stutterers as possible. I started stuttering back when I was around 4 years old. It was not a fun time for me growing up especially during middle and high school. I never really raised my hand, presentations were rough, I used to get a lot of anxiety whenever the teacher would say "let's go around the room" because I knew I was guaranteed to embarrass myself. I no longer wanted to feel this way. Not only that but I also stutter when I am alone which makes me a bit of an outlier, and yes I do like to speak to myself because it helps makes me reason through things. One day, I was driving my car to university and I thought of a sentence that I thought would be really hard to say out loud, and then I ended up verbalizing it completely fluently. It didn't even make sense. That was the moment that really flashed a light bulb in my head, that stuttering is actually able to be beat. That is ultimately when I got the belief that stuttering can be entirely reversed, that it is not some mythical brain defect that prevents me from speaking.
            Ever since then I started doing a lot of self-experimentation for years to see what would work so that I could replicate that moment. I tried to stretch out my syllables, I tried to use a gentle onset at the beginning of each word, I tried to exhale before speaking, I tried all sorts of techniques taught in tradition speech therapy in other words. None of them ended up being effective for very long and they did not end up working in the real world. A lot of other people ended up saying the same thing that speech therapy hasn't really worked for them. I ended up doing more self-experimentation until I made a big discovery:
            That every time my mouth moved to the correct position before my intention to actually start speaking was when I was able to say words completely fluently. And of course I ran with this idea and tested it out to the point where it ended up producing very consistent results. This is the point where I was completely sold on the idea that stuttering is not at all genetic because my genetic makeup didn't just magically change when I was doing these self-experiments.
            This was what sparked my interest in even more in order to not waste the knowledge that I have acquired. This knowledge cannot be found through books or through the education system because books and the education system take years before updating up-to-date information. Although this mission statement is brief, the work is not. I aim to inspire as many stutterers as possible to successfully reverse their condition in order to increase their quality of life, in order to get the personality that you know you desire.
